# Task Manager Application

## Overview
The Task Manager is a web application built using **React.js** and **TypeScript** for managing tasks. It allows users to add, delete, mark tasks as completed, set task priorities, and search for tasks. Tasks are persisted in **localStorage**, which ensures that the tasks remain available even after the page is reloaded.

### Features
1. **Task Input**: Allows the user to add tasks with a title and set their priority (High, Medium, Low).
2. **Task Deletion**: Allows the user to delete tasks.
3. **Task Persistence**: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage to ensure persistence across page reloads.
4. **Task Search**: Users can search for tasks by title.
5. **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
6. **Priority Setting**: Users can assign a priority level to each task (High, Medium, Low).
7. **Task Sorting**: Tasks can be sorted based on their priority.
8. **UI Animation**: Smooth animations are applied when tasks are added, deleted, or marked as completed using **Framer Motion**.
